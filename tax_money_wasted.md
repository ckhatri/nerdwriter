[Why So Much Tax Money Is Wasted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvC6kwU3zgA)

* The US Government wastes a lot of taxpayer money.
* Bush signs Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which looked for waste.
* Found 105 STEM programs totally 3 billion, but only 10 of them had evaluations that were worth anything, and only 4 were effective.
* Decisions to pay are based on costs, public opinion, lobbyists, and ideology. So everything but **evidence**
* People are getting more productive, but the government is taking longer to catch up
* Need to implement randomized controlled trials, which are the gold standard for social policies
* Government should only give money to people who do this, and have rigorous studies multiple times.
* Money should be given to stuff that works.
* Evidence based policy can't work for everything, but if you can include science into the decision making process, you make the government more effective.
* There is a deep boring ocean of governance, it's our job to wade into it.
