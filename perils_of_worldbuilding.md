[Middle Earth and The Perils of Worldbuilding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA6MQHNM2yE)

* fantasy worlds create autonomous, consistent worlds, which cause fans to eat it up, or make it up themselves
* world building shifts away from the reading.
* world building assumes a passive reader, the author writes the details and encodes the world for the reader through the words
* reading is two important parts, the writers words and then the reader's interpretation
* world building is the view that you're given everything, and the story is consistent and stays the exact same
* political worldbuilding is terrible, giving people a built world.
