[Helm's Deep: How To Film An Epic Battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn2-PUq1Z84)

* use silence because a battle is a lot of sound so this creates a contrast
* helps deem is full of contrast because it's 39 minutes. It's a movie within a movie.
* can break battle into 24 beats which show the rhythm
* majority of the battle is monochromatic
* use strong backlight, to bring things into focus but keep it monochromatic
* each beat has an emotional feel
* inciting incident -> growing obstacles -> mini triumphs -> roaring victorious climax when things are at most dire
* this parallels the story as well.
* LOTR movie has to be real enough to be taken in emotionally, but must also be fantastical
* helms deep is self-contained but it's also a big part of the entire movie.
* helms deep is the reason epic battles exist.
