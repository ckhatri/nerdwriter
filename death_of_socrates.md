[Death of Socrates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKhfFBbVtFg)

* exemplar of neoclassical period of France
* clarity of scene, fierce gestures, angles of light.
* Socrates was sentenced to death for corrupting the youth and not accepting the Gods
* Socrates could have escaped, but death should not be feared by the philosopher but should be accepted.
* light pours onto Socrates, hands in defiance
* Socrates is a symbol of strength over passion, commitment to an abstract ideal.
* YO OATH OF HORATII WAS IN ART HISTORY
* invented the neoclassical style, ancient obsession of muscles and the physical bodies
* in direct opposition to Rococo which reflected the helenistic ideals of the monarchy
* read right to left, or read left to right
* guy resting on back of bed is Plato, so it looks like the scene is coming out from his head as an idealized memory
* Socrates gestures same way as Plato gestures in Rafael's School of Athens
* so much is happening, interplay of historical, personal, aesthetic elements. It's a work of genius.
