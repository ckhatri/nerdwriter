[Lord Of The Rings: How Music Elevates Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7BkmF8CJpQ)

* before you see one single image in LOTR, you hear a chorus singing in an unsettling harmonic minor key, this is a theme signaling the Lothlorian Theme. The theme of Galadrial who narrates it
* as the themes changes, the narrators change and the lighter themes come in again.
* Howard Shore uses Leitmotif, fuse musical themes with specific people or places, which helps augments the story.
* fellowship is growing, brass section grows as well
* fellowship gets mixed in with wraith theme after Frodo gets stabbed, saying the fellowship might end before it even starts.
* full statement in the Mines of Moria, 3/4 gets swallowed by the 5/4.
* after Gandalf is lost, the theme will only be used in fragments
* broken themes herald the death of Boromir
* music is an invisible layer that guides the movie and our emotions
* result is a score that is alive as the world Tolkien gave us.
