[Who Should Have Right To Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SY119Eib1g)

* "Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign" - John Stuart Mill
* personal autonomy has become synonymous with dignity, to allow for mercy deaths
* Euthanasia Society of America was first group to push for merciful release
* 2003 we have Compassion and Choices, to help create a better phrase.
* use the words dignity to help justify physician assisted death
* only 5 states allow it, and you must be terminally ill, otherwise it's not a rational decision. 
* people choose for assisted death because they don't want to lose their dignity.
* progressives state that people with defects must live with it for their entire life, and they have dignity no matter what so it's not okay to do this.
* "at the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life and death"
